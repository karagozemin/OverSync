/**
 * @fileoverview Single-flight relay submission tracking for cross-chain orders.
 *
 * Three doors used to be able to move money for one order at the same time:
 * the `/api/orders/*` request handlers, the recovery service, and the refund
 * watchdog. Two submissions for one order could therefore *claim* the funds and
 * *refund* them at the same time, and a timed-out RPC could be retried into a
 * second broadcast of the same logical payment.
 *
 * This module is the only door they share. It guarantees, per
 * (orderId, side, action):
 *
 *  1. **One in-flight submission.** The key is reserved before any work starts,
 *     so overlapping callers collapse onto a single broadcast.
 *  2. **One action per order.** A submission holds an order-level lock
 *     (`orderId|side`). A second *action* on the same order — e.g. a refund
 *     while a claim is pending — is refused with {@link RelayOrderBusyError}.
 *  3. **Hash before broadcast.** A submission is staged in two phases: the
 *     caller computes the transaction hash locally (Stellar: the envelope hash,
 *     Ethereum: keccak of the signed payload), and only then may it broadcast.
 *     The tracker persists `txHash` + `network` + `status` *before* the
 *     broadcast closure is invoked, so a crash mid-broadcast still leaves a
 *     hash to reconcile against.
 *  4. **Retry attaches to the original hash.** Once a hash exists the executor
 *     is never called again. A retry polls the stored hash through the
 *     `confirm` hook until it reaches a terminal state, so an ambiguous RPC can
 *     never produce a second on-chain transaction.
 *  5. **Restart safety.** Records are written to a {@link RelaySubmissionStore}
 *     on every transition. A confirmed hash is rehydrated and returned from
 *     cache instead of being resubmitted; a broadcast-but-unconfirmed hash is
 *     rehydrated as `pending` and reconciled by polling.
 *
 * The module is deliberately dependency-free (only `node:crypto`, and
 * `node:fs`/`node:path` for the bundled file store) so it is easy to unit test
 * without a live chain: every network interaction is injected as `confirm`.
